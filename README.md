# Market-Association-Rule

About the Dataset
1. Introduction
In this document, we explore a dataset designed for association rules mining, a key technique in market basket analysis. The dataset includes various items typically found in retail transactions. Each item is represented as a binary variable, with "1" meaning the item is present and "0" meaning it is absent in individual transactions.

2. Dataset Overview
Our dataset unfolds as a rich tapestry of distinct columns, each dedicated to representing a specific item:

Bread
Honey
Bacon
Toothpaste
Banana
Apple
Hazelnut
Cheese
Meat
Carrot
Cucumber
Onion
Milk
Butter
ShavingFoam
Salt
Flour
HeavyCream
Egg
Olive
Shampoo
Sugar

 Purpose of the Dataset
The purpose of this dataset is to uncover complex associations and patterns hidden within the network of customer transactions. Each row in the dataset represents a single transaction, and the values in each column indicate whether a particular item was included in the transaction or not.

4. Data Format
The data in this repository is presented in binary form: "1" means an item was purchased, and "0" means it was not. This simple binary format highlights whether an item is present in a transaction, rather than how many of each item were bought.
